Requisites
==========

* node.js >= 0.10
* npm
* [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) >= 0.4

Running
=======

```sh
cd server/old
npm install
npm start
```

This will compile the coffeescript using Grunt into a Javascript
file and start the server.

Running `grunt watch` will continuously re-build the Javascript file
as the source files change.
